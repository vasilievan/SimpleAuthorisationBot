# SimpleAuthorisationBot

There are really specific settings in this project, but the main is an idea. It's possible to code an authorisation program (or password manager) using only standart Java library. A few functions are presented here: mouse moving, left/right mouse button click, reading from system text buffer, input simulation; but there are enough.

That's a gif demo: https://yadi.sk/i/02l8H6usl_cQyQ (you have to download it if you want it animated).
